//debug and PartialEq are types of derivable traits from the fmt. there are others thought
//https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait/derive.html
//Debug helps to format a value using the {:?} formatter. It defines what is displayed when the {:?} is used against 
//an enum or stuct

//any struct or enum that does not add this derive word can not be printed with the println! 
//struct Seconds(i32);
//let _one_second = Seconds(1);// in this place the defination of the seconds structs lacks the derive keyword
//if you try to print a value of type seconds, it fails
// Error: `Seconds` can't be printed; it doesn't implement the `Debug` trait
//println!("One second looks like: {:?}", _one_second);
// TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

//the PartialEq is used to make types comparable. And defines what is meant by equality
// Error: `Seconds` can't be compared; it doesn't implement the `PartialEq` trait
//let _this_is_true = (_one_second == _one_second);
